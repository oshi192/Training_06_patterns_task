```
Create the necessary entities and simulate changes in the state of the object "Man" 
in "Hunter", "Fisherman", "Mushroom" depending on his condition:
- is located - on the river bank,
- is located - on the mushroom glade,
- sees the beast.
```
__I used the "[State](https://gist.github.com/oshi192/1a1a0c623f8e612336f4e5eaf2194e1d#file-20-state-md)" pattern__
